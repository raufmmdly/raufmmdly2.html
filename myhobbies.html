<h1>In my free time, I love staying active by playing football. It’s not just a sport for me; it’s a way to disconnect and stay fit while having fun with friends. Music also plays a huge role in my life. I enjoy listening to different genres, especially drama, jazz, and indie. They help me relax and focus, especially when I’m studying or unwinding after a long day. One of my favorite things to do is study with my friend Rafa, although we have very different tastes in music. While I’m into more mellow tunes, Rafa’s music taste can be... let’s say, unique. But despite the teasing, it makes our study sessions more fun and memorable.</h1>
